# New York Air BnB - Price Rental Analytics Report
Air BnB Prediction Values Project (Python)

The year is 2016 and I had decided to sell my apartment in Hoboken New Jersey and move out to the suberbs to make room for my 
expanding family. Trying to save on costs and maximize return, I decided to try to list and sell the apartment myself rather 
than using a realtor. In my reasearch for what sale price to list my apartment, I learned it was best to use prices of similar 
neighboring properties which had recently sold.
After completing this task I decided it was time to list my apartment on the open market which came with a slew of calls from 
real estate agents offering their services to help me sell the apartment. One day, during one of the agent conversations I had 
answered, I received the question, "How did you decide what amount to sell it for?" 
to which I told him I researched previously sold values of similar properties nearby. 
The agent told me, "You did a good job, this is exactly the price I would have listed it for."

Years later in my efforts to expand on my data science skillset, I read about the k nearest neighbors algorithm. 
After reading how this algorithm works, a light bulb went off in my head. I used this algorithm years ago without even knowing it! 
I said to myself, "I wonder how well I could do in predicting real estate values on an expanded data set?"

This what lead my to the project below where I will attempt to predict rental values for Air BnB rentals for the Bronx borough of New York City.
